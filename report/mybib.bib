abstract = { Sequential estimators are derived for suboptimal adaptive estimation of the unknown a priori state and observation noise statistics simultaneously with the system state. First- and second-order moments of the noise processes are estimated based on state and observation noise samples generated in the Kalman filter algorithm. A limited memory algorithm is developed for adaptive correction of the a priori statistics which are intended to compensate for time-varying model errors. The algorithm provides improved state estimates at little computational expense when applied to an orbit determination problem for a near-earth satellite with significant modeling errors.},

abstract = {Respiratory ailments are important causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Ethnobotanical surveys and literature reviews conducted in Guatemala during 1986-88 showed that 234 plants from 75 families, most of them of American origin, have been used for the treatment of respiratory ailments. Three Gram-positive bacteria causing respiratory infections (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes) were used to screen 68 of the most commonly used plants for activity. Twenty-eight of these (41.2{\%}) inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria tested. Staphylococcus aureus was inhibited by 18 of the plant extracts, while 7 extracts were effective against Streptococcus pyogenes. Plants of American origin which exhibited antibacterial activity were: Gnaphalium viscosum, Lippia alba, Lippia dulcis, Physalis philadelphica, Satureja brownei, Solanum nigrescens and Tagetes lucida. These preliminary in vitro results provide scientific basis for the use of these plants against bacterial respiratory infections.},

abstract = {Results: Twenty-four articles were identified that met the inclusion criteria. From those articles, 39 variables were identified across five domains. Results showed that boys were more active than girls, that children with active parents tended to be more active, and that children who spent more time outdoors were more active than children who spent less time outdoors. Age and BMI were consistently shown to have no association with preschool children's physical activity. Other variables produced largely inconclusive results. Conclusions: The influences on the physical activity behaviors of preschool children are multidimen-sional. Further research is required to enhance an understanding of these influences.},

@article{Dehghannasiri2018,
abstract = {IEEE In many practical filter design problems, the exact statistical information of the underlying random processes is not available. One robust filtering approach in these situations is to design an intrinsically Bayesian robust filter that provides optimal solution relative to the prior distribution governing the uncertainty class of all possible joint random process models. In this context, the intrinsically Bayesian robust Kalman filter has been recently introduced for the case that the second-order statistics of the observation and process noise in the state-space model are unknown. However, such a filter does not utilize the additional information embedded in the data being observed. In this paper, we derive the optimal Bayesian Kalman filter which is optimal over posterior distribution obtained from incorporating data into prior distribution. This filter has the same recursive structure as that of the classical Kalman filter, except that it is designed relative to the posterior effective noise statistics which are found by employing the method of factor graphs through formulating the problem of computing the likelihood function as a message passing algorithm.},

abstract = {The classical filtering and prediction problem is re-examined using the Bode- Shannon representation of random processes and the state transition method of analysis of dynamic systems. New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modifica- tion to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite- memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co- efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are ob- tained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

@techreport{Kschischang2001,
abstract = {Algorithms that must deal with complicated global functions of many variables often exploit the manner in which the given functions factor as a product of "local" functions, each of which depends on a subset of the variables. Such a factorization can be visualized with a bipartite graph that we call a factor graph. In this tutorial paper, we present a generic message-passing algorithm , the sum-product algorithm, that operates in a factor graph. Following a single, simple computational rule, the sum-product algorithm computes-either exactly or approximately-various marginal functions derived from the global function. A wide variety of algorithms developed in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and digital communications can be derived as specific instances of the sum-product algorithm, including the forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, the iterative "turbo" decoding algorithm, Pearl's belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian networks, the Kalman filter, and certain fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms.},
