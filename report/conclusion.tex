\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

The OBKF provides the optimal estimation relative to the posterior distribution. Since it utilizes the prior knowledge, it doesn't require a lot of data compared with the adaptive filter. 
However, the OBKF is computationally expensive. This problem can be solved if the environment is static or the change of the unknown parameter is small. Developing more efficient algorithm is a future work.
Also, if the prior distribution of the OBKF is very different from the true prior distribution, the OBKF doesn't converge to the optimal estimation. This is another drawback of the OBKF.
